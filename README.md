|----------|----------------|--------------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | [Linux Networking Basics](#-week-1-linux-networking-basics) | `ip a`, `ip r`, `ping`, `hostname`, `whoami`, `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/resolv.conf` | Understand IP setup, DNS basics, hostname resolution | ðŸ”¹ Run `ip a` and explain your IP<br>ðŸ”¹ Ping Google and your gateway<br>ðŸ”¹ Edit `/etc/hosts` to add a fake domain |
| 2 | [Connectivity & Routing](#-week-2-connectivity--routing) | `traceroute`, `ss`, `netstat`, `ip route`, `curl`, `wget` | Understand routing, active connections, ports | ðŸ”¹ Trace route to Google<br>ðŸ”¹ View open ports with `ss -tuln`<br>ðŸ”¹ Get public IP with `curl ifconfig.me` |
| 3 | DNS & Name Resolution | `dig`, `nslookup`, `resolvectl` | Learn DNS lookup and troubleshooting | ðŸ”¹ Use `dig` to resolve a domain<br>ðŸ”¹ Change DNS server temporarily<br>ðŸ”¹ Break/fix DNS via `/etc/resolv.conf` |
| 4 | SSH & File Transfers | `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`, `sshd`, `.ssh/config` | Remote access and secure file transfer | ðŸ”¹ Connect to another machine via SSH<br>ðŸ”¹ Copy file with `scp`<br>ðŸ”¹ Create an SSH alias in `.ssh/config` |
| 5 | Firewalls & Security | `ufw`, `iptables`, `fail2ban` *(optional)* | Configure basic firewall rules | ðŸ”¹ Enable `ufw` and allow SSH<br>ðŸ”¹ Block non-essential ports<br>ðŸ”¹ Test firewall rule functionality |
| 6 | Scanning & Traffic Monitoring | `nmap`, `tcpdump`, `iftop`, `nethogs` | Scan networks, monitor traffic & bandwidth | ðŸ”¹ Scan your LAN with `nmap`<br>ðŸ”¹ Capture packets with `tcpdump`<br>ðŸ”¹ Monitor usage with `iftop` or `nethogs` |



## ðŸ“… Week 1: Linux Networking Basics  
**Goal:** Understand how your computer connects to a network and resolves names (like websites).

---

### ðŸ”§ Tools/Commands You'll Use:
- `ip a`
- `ip r`
- `ping`
- `hostname` / `whoami`
- `/etc/hosts`
- `/etc/resolv.conf`

---

### âœ… Tasks & Challenges

| # | Task | Command or Action | What You're Learning |
|---|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Check your IP address | `ip a` | See your IP and interface names (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`) |
| 2 | Find your default gateway | `ip r` | Shows how your traffic routes to the internet |
| 3 | Test connectivity | `ping 8.8.8.8` or `ping google.com` | Test if you can reach another machine |
| 4 | See your hostname and user | `hostname`, `whoami` | Your computerâ€™s name and current user |
| 5 | Look inside your hosts file | `cat /etc/hosts` | Understand how name resolution works locally |
| 6 | Add a fake domain to hosts | Add `127.0.0.1 myfake.local` to `/etc/hosts` | Map a fake domain to localhost |
| 7 | Check DNS config | `cat /etc/resolv.conf` | See which DNS server your system uses |
| 8 | Try breaking name resolution | Comment out DNS in `/etc/resolv.conf`, try `ping google.com` | Understand what happens when DNS fails (be cautious!) |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Mini Project:
Create a cheat sheet markdown file with:
- Your current IP address
- Default gateway
- Notes on what each command does

## ðŸ“… Week 2: Connectivity & Routing
**Goal:** Understand how your computer reaches other networks, what connections itâ€™s making, and how to explore them.

### ðŸ”§ Tools You'll Use:
- `traceroute`
- `ss / netstat`
- `ip route`
- `curl`
- `wget`

### âœ… Tasks & Challenges

| # | Task | Command or Action | What You're Learning |
|---|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1	| Trace the path to a website | `traceroute google.com` | See how traffic moves across networks (needs traceroute package) |
| 2	| View active network connections | `ss -tuln` or `netstat -tuln` | Learn about open ports and listening services |
| 3	| List routing table | `ip route` | Understand how your system knows where to send traffic |
| 4	| Get your public IP address | `curl ifconfig.me` |	See how your system appears on the internet |
| 5	| Download a webpage manually | `curl https://example.com` or `wget https://example.com` | Practice using network tools to test HTTP requests |
| 6	| Save a webpage to a file | `wget https://example.com -o example.html`	| Explore basic file transfer over HTTP |
| 7	| Scan for a known port	| `ss -ltn sport = :22` | See if a specific port (e.g. SSH) is open and listening |

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Mini-Project:
Create a markdown report:
- Summary of what each command does
- Output samples from your system (anonymized if needed)
- Questions you had or things you want to explore further
