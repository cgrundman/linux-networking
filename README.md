## ðŸ“… Part 3: DNS & Name Resolution
**Goal:** Learn how your system looks up domain names, troubleshoot DNS issues, and manipulate DNS settings.

---

### ðŸ”§ Tools You'll Use:
 - `dig`
 - `nslookup`
 - `resolvectl`
 - `/etc/resolv.conf`

---

### âœ… Tasks & Challenges

| # | Task | Command or Action | What Youâ€™re Learning |
|---|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Resolve a domain with `dig` | `dig google.com` | See how dig works and what information it returns (e.g., IP, DNS server) |
| 2 | Check DNS records with `nslookup` | `nslookup google.com` | Use nslookup to get A records (IPv4) or other records (e.g., MX for mail) |
| 3 | View current DNS settings with `resolvectl` | `resolvectl status` | See which DNS servers your system is using |
| 4 | Change DNS server temporarily | `sudo resolvectl dns eth0 8.8.8.8` | Learn how to change your DNS server temporarily for a network interface (eth0 in this case) |
| 5 | Check DNS resolution with `dig` after changing servers | `dig google.com` | Verify that DNS resolution uses the new DNS server |
| 6 | Inspect `/etc/resolv.conf` | `cat /etc/resolv.conf` | Look at your DNS configuration file and understand how it works |
| 7 | Temporarily break DNS | Edit `/etc/resolv.conf` and comment out nameserver lines | See what happens when DNS is broken (try ping google.com or dig google.com) |
| 8 | Fix DNS by restoring `/etc/resolv.conf` | Re-add a valid DNS server to `/etc/resolv.conf` | Learn how to restore DNS functionality by editing the config file |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Mini-Project:
Write a brief report explaining:
 - The differences between `dig`, `nslookup`, and `resolvectl`
 - How DNS resolution works on your system
 - Any troubleshooting steps you took and how they fixed the DNS issues

---

## ðŸ“… Part 4: SSH & File Transfers
**Goal:** Learn to connect to remote systems securely, transfer files, and streamline your workflow with SSH configuration.

---

### ðŸ”§ Tools You'll Use:
 - `ssh`
 - `scp`
 - `rsync`
 - `sshd`
 - `~/.ssh/config`

---

### âœ… Tasks & Challenges
| # | Task | Command or Action | What Youâ€™re Learning |
|---|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Test local SSH server (optional if available) | `ssh localhost` or `ssh user@your-ip` | Verify that SSH is installed and working locally |
| 2 | Connect to a remote machine | `ssh user@remote-ip` | Learn to access another system via SSH (can be a Raspberry Pi, virtual machine, or test server) |
| 3 | Copy a file to remote machine using `scp` | `scp myfile.txt user@remote-ip:~/home/user/` | Practice secure file transfer |
| 4 | Copy from remote to local | `scp user@remote-ip:~/home/user/notes.txt ./` | Download files from a remote system |
| 5 | Use rsync for syncing files | `rsync -av myfolder/ user@remote-ip:~/home/user/myfolder/` | Efficiently sync folders with resume and delta support |
| 6 | Add an SSH alias in `~/.ssh/config` | Add a block like: `Host myserver/HostName 192.168.1.10/User alice` | Connect using ssh myserver instead of the full command |
| 7 | Use the alias for `scp` or `ssh` | `scp file.txt myserver:~/tmp/` | Confirm your alias works for all SSH-based tools |
| 8 | Restart or verify `sshd` (if self-hosting) | `sudo systemctl status ssh` or `sudo systemctl restart ssh` | Ensure your machine is accepting SSH connections (skip if not hosting) |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Mini-Project:
Create a simple script to sync a folder of notes between two machines using `rsync` and your `.ssh/config` alias.

---

## ðŸ“… Part 5: Firewalls & Security
**Goal:** Learn how to control incoming/outgoing traffic on your system, manage firewall rules, and understand basic network-level security.

---

### ðŸ”§ Tools Youâ€™ll Use:
 - `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall)
 - `iptables` (optional, advanced)
 - `nmap` (for scanning open ports)
 - `netcat` (nc, for basic listening/connections)

---

### âœ… Tasks & Concepts
| # | Task | Command or Action | What Youâ€™re Learning |
|---|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Check firewall status	 | `sudo ufw status`	| See if a firewall is running and what it allows/blocks |
| 2	| Enable the firewall | `sudo ufw enable`	| Turn on basic firewall protection |
| 3	| Allow SSH through firewall | `sudo ufw allow ssh`	| Keep remote access open while firewall is on |
| 4	| Block a port (e.g., 8080) | `sudo ufw deny 8080`	| Understand how to restrict unwanted services |
| 5	| Check open ports with `nmap` | `nmap localhost`	| Learn how to scan your system from a network perspective |
| 6	| Open a test port using `netcat` | `nc -l 8888`	| Simulate a service listening on a port |
| 7	| Block and unblock that test port | Use `ufw deny 8888`, test with `nmap`, then `ufw delete deny 8888`	| Practice verifying and managing rules |
| 8	| View raw firewall rules (optional) | `sudo iptables -L`	| See the underlying system firewall configuration |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Mini-Project:
**"Lockdown and Access Test":** Set up a local service (like Python HTTP server or netcat), scan it with nmap, then block it with UFW. Write a short log of the steps and what you observed.

---

## ðŸ“… Part 6: Network Monitoring & Diagnostics
**Goal:** Learn to inspect network traffic, monitor usage, and diagnose issues with real-time and historical tools.

---

### ðŸ”§ Tools Youâ€™ll Use:
 - `iftop` or `nethogs`
 - `tcpdump`
 - `netstat` / `ss`

| 2 | View open ports and listening services | `ss -tuln` or `netstat -tuln` | Real-time info on what ports are being used |
| 3 | Capture packets on an interface | `sudo tcpdump -i <interface>` | See actual packets being sent and received |
| 4 | Capture and save packets to a file | `sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -w capture.pcap` | Store traffic to analyze later with Wireshark |
| 5 | Inspect network interfaces and stats | `ip a and ip -s link` | View traffic and errors on each network device |
| 6 | Read kernel logs for network errors | `dmesg` | grep ethorjournalctl -u NetworkManager` |
| 7 | Filter tcpdump for a specific port or host | `sudo tcpdump port 22` or `host google.com` | Learn to target traffic of interest |
| 8 | (Optional) Analyze .pcap with Wireshark | Open `capture.pcap` in Wireshark | Use a GUI to visually inspect traffic patterns |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Mini-Project:
**"Whatâ€™s My Network Doing?":** 
1. Run iftop or nethogs while browsing and downloading files.
2. Capture packets using tcpdump during the activity.
3. Analyze the .pcap file or summarize the activity:
     - What IPs were contacted?
     - What ports were used?
     - What used the most bandwidth?
