## ðŸ“… Week 1: Linux Networking Basics  
**Goal:** Understand how your computer connects to a network and resolves names (like websites).

---

### ðŸ”§ Tools/Commands You'll Use:
- `ip a`
- `ip r`
- `ping`
- `hostname` / `whoami`
- `/etc/hosts`
- `/etc/resolv.conf`

---

### âœ… Tasks & Challenges

| # | Task | Command or Action | What You're Learning |
|---|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Check your IP address | `ip a` | See your IP and interface names (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`) |
| 2 | Find your default gateway | `ip r` | Shows how your traffic routes to the internet |
| 3 | Test connectivity | `ping 8.8.8.8` or `ping google.com` | Test if you can reach another machine |
| 4 | See your hostname and user | `hostname`, `whoami` | Your computerâ€™s name and current user |
| 5 | Look inside your hosts file | `cat /etc/hosts` | Understand how name resolution works locally |
| 6 | Add a fake domain to hosts | Add `127.0.0.1 myfake.local` to `/etc/hosts` | Map a fake domain to localhost |
| 7 | Check DNS config | `cat /etc/resolv.conf` | See which DNS server your system uses |
| 8 | Try breaking name resolution | Comment out DNS in `/etc/resolv.conf`, try `ping google.com` | Understand what happens when DNS fails (be cautious!) |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Mini Project:
Create a cheat sheet markdown file with:
- Your current IP address
- Default gateway
- Notes on what each command does


## ðŸ“… Week 2: Connectivity & Routing
**Goal:** Understand how your computer reaches other networks, what connections itâ€™s making, and how to explore them.

### ðŸ”§ Tools You'll Use:
- `traceroute`
- `ss / netstat`
- `ip route`
- `curl`
- `wget`

### âœ… Tasks & Challenges

| # | Task | Command or Action | What You're Learning |
|---|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1	| Trace the path to a website | `traceroute google.com` | See how traffic moves across networks (needs traceroute package) |
| 2	| View active network connections | `ss -tuln` or `netstat -tuln` | Learn about open ports and listening services |
| 3	| List routing table | `ip route` | Understand how your system knows where to send traffic |
| 4	| Get your public IP address | `curl ifconfig.me` |	See how your system appears on the internet |
| 5	| Download a webpage manually | `curl https://example.com` or `wget https://example.com` | Practice using network tools to test HTTP requests |
| 6	| Save a webpage to a file | `wget https://example.com -o example.html`	| Explore basic file transfer over HTTP |
| 7	| Scan for a known port	| `ss -ltn sport = :22` | See if a specific port (e.g. SSH) is open and listening |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Mini-Project:
Create a markdown report:
- Summary of what each command does
- Output samples from your system (anonymized if needed)
- Questions you had or things you want to explore further

## ðŸ“… Week 3: DNS & Name Resolution
**Goal:** Learn how your system looks up domain names, troubleshoot DNS issues, and manipulate DNS settings.

### ðŸ”§ Tools You'll Use:
 - `dig`
 - `nslookup`
 - `resolvectl`
 - `/etc/resolv.conf`

### âœ… Tasks & Challenges

| # | Task | Command or Action | What Youâ€™re Learning |
|---|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Resolve a domain with `dig` | `dig google.com` | See how dig works and what information it returns (e.g., IP, DNS server) |
| 2 | Check DNS records with `nslookup` | `nslookup google.com` | Use nslookup to get A records (IPv4) or other records (e.g., MX for mail) |
| 3 | View current DNS settings with `resolvectl` | `resolvectl status` | See which DNS servers your system is using |
| 4 | Change DNS server temporarily | `sudo resolvectl dns eth0 8.8.8.8` | Learn how to change your DNS server temporarily for a network interface (eth0 in this case) |
| 5 | Check DNS resolution with `dig` after changing servers | `dig google.com` | Verify that DNS resolution uses the new DNS server |
| 6 | Inspect `/etc/resolv.conf` | `cat /etc/resolv.conf` | Look at your DNS configuration file and understand how it works |
| 7 | Temporarily break DNS | Edit `/etc/resolv.conf` and comment out nameserver lines | See what happens when DNS is broken (try ping google.com or dig google.com) |
| 8 | Fix DNS by restoring `/etc/resolv.conf` | Re-add a valid DNS server to `/etc/resolv.conf` | Learn how to restore DNS functionality by editing the config file |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Mini-Project:
Write a brief report explaining:
 - The differences between `dig`, `nslookup`, and `resolvectl`
 - How DNS resolution works on your system
 - Any troubleshooting steps you took and how they fixed the DNS issues
